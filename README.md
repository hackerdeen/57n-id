57North ID
==========

57North ID is a service which allows 57North members to log into services using one set of credentials.
It provides a CAS-compliant endpoint, which is widely supported by most languages and popular frameworks.
It is backed off an LDAP database running on shell.hackr.org.uk.

Members in the "id-admins" group can register a new application to use the CAS server by logging into id.57north.org.uk, clicking "More services...", and clicking "Create new service".

Members in the "id-admins" group can create accounts for new members from the "Create new user" link in the "List users" menu.

There is infrastructure for guest users, this will be expanded with a signup form in the future.
